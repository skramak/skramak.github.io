# Problem Set 0: Practicing Git and Building a Webpage

This problem set is designed to get you started with Git and Github pages. Use this exercise to get all of the software and tools (i.e., Github, Atom, Python) installed and running on your machine. You will set up a website, practice the standard Git workflow, and make one simple modification to the provided `first-script.py` script.

On the assignment tab of the course Stellar website, submit the link to your Github profile.

## Create your github.io page (10 points)

Following the instructions found in Part 1 of the in-class tutorial, create your Github pages site. We will revisit this page later in the course as we build on our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can customize it further then. For now, though, include at least the following:

1. Your name, styled as a main heading (`<h1></h1>`)
2. A one paragraph bio, styled as a paragraph (`<p></p>`)
3. An image of and link to a visualization project you find inspiring (try the `<img />` and `<a></a>` elements)

Remember to stage, commit, and push your changes to your Github pages repository!

## Modify the Python Script (5 points)

Fork a copy of the class repository. Then clone your fork of the repo. Finally, duplicate the `first-script.py` into the provided 'submission' folder. Change the message that the script prints to the console. Stage, commit, push! As a reminder, this push will store your changes in the FORK of the class repo, not the original class repo. So don't worry about breaking it!
