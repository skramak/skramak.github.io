	<p>I am a first year Master in City Planning at MIT DUSP.
My focus is in Environmental Planning and Policy.
Specifically, I'm interested in climate change, its distributional impacts, as well as infrastructure histories. I'm originally from Phoenix, AZ but have lived in the Boston Area since the summer of 2015.  </p>
